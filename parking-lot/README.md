# Parking Lot

Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

The parking system should support the following API:
- AddCar(carType): Check if there is a parking lot with a parking space type that matches the carType. Return true, if there is and false otherwise.
